Local Clustering Formula

The local clustering coefficient of a node in a graph is given by dividing the number of links between nodes within its neighborhood by the number of possible links that could exist between them.
For a directed graph, for each neighborhood, there are K * (K - 1) where K is the number of nodes in its neighborhood.

LCF = |Links between vertices in neighborhood| / (K * (K - 1))
